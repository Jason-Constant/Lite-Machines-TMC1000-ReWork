# Lite-Machines-TMC1000-ReWork
This project is designed as a step by step process to work around the proprietary hardware and software, that has been out of date for years, on the Lite Machines TMC1000 CNC machine. This project will allow you to build an updated control module for the CNC machine with modern parts and modern software (PlanetCNC).
