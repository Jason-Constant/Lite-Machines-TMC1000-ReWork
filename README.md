# Lite-Machines-TMC1000-ReWork
This project is designed as a step by step process to work around the proprietary hardware and software that has been out of date for years, on the Lite Machines TMC1000 CNC machine. This project will allow you to build an updated the controller module for the CNC machine with modern harware (Raspberry Pi / Planet CNC Controller) and modern software (PlanetCNC).

This project was created by the teachers and students at Nashua High School South in the Manufacturing class. The problem came apparent that there were many CNC machines not being used, or non functional around the classroom. The students decided to tackle the problem and get the machines running and useful for the next years classes. The following is work done from the students and teachers and has been documented as open-source instructions to try and help anyone with building the TMC1000 CNC machine, as well as many like it.

All of the parts used in the project can be found in the "name" folder with the excel file, or the google sheets file.

Step 1:
        This project was designed to be ran off of a RaspberryPi 4 Model B (8GB), and the Plant CNC Mk3/4 (4 axis) controller. Connect the RaspberryPi and the controler via USB.
